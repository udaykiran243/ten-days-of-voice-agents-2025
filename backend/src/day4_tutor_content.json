    "summary": "Loops allow code to be repeated multiple times without writing the same lines over and over. A 'For Loop' is used when you know how many times to repeat (like 10 times). A 'While Loop' repeats as long as a certain condition is true (like while the player is still alive).",

    "summary": "A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. You 'call' the function whenever you need that task done. It helps keep code organized and reusable, so you don't repeat yourself (DRY principle).",
